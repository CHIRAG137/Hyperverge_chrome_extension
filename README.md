# Hyperverge Chrome Extension

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and use the extension-

### Step 1: Clone the RepositorY

First, clone the repository to your local machine

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CHIRAG137/Hyperverge_chrome_extension
```
### Step 2:
I have added all the environemnt variables in the code only so that you can use them directly and do not have to make on your owns, so there is no env file.

### Step 3:
Once cloned go to a fresh browser home page and click on right top corner bar and select extensions.

### Step 4:
Click on load unpacked and then select the extension folder from the cloned repo. Then you are good to go and use the extension.
